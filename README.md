# Remote Brainstorming - Omron Robotic Arm

Please download the software, [ACE from Omron](https://automation.omron.com/en/us/forms/ace-robot-software-download-request-form), to operate the robot.

There are three wires coming out from the robotic arm:
```
  1. **Ethernaet Cable (with USB adapter)**: Use directly to program and run the robot controller with ACE software.
  2. **USB Cable (with Matt's name on it)**: Use to access the interior information from the controller, ex. resetting the timer.
  3. **USB Serial communication Cable (transparent one)**: Use to do serial communication with the processor.
```

Please refer to individual section detailed intructions or steps:
