# Remote Brainstorming - Omron Robotic Arm

Please download the software, [ACE from Omron](https://automation.omron.com/en/us/forms/ace-robot-software-download-request-form), to operate the robot.

There are three wires coming out from the robotic arm:

  - **Ethernaet Cable (with USB adapter)**: Use directly to program and run the robot controller with ACE software.
  - **USB Cable (with Matt's name on it)**: Use to access the interior information from the controller, ex. resetting the timer.
  - **USB Serial communication Cable (transparent one)**: Use to do serial communication with the processor.


Please refer to individual section detailed intructions or steps:

- [**Drawing Area Setting and Calibration**](https://github.com/riglab/Remote-Brainstorming-Omron-Robotic-Arm/blob/master/README.md#drawing-area-calibration)
- [**Tasks Running**](https://github.com/riglab/Remote-Brainstorming-Omron-Robotic-Arm/blob/master/README.md#tasks-running)
- [**Processing**](https://github.com/riglab/Remote-Brainstorming-Omron-Robotic-Arm/blob/master/README.md#processing)


## Starting
1) Turn on the power of the robot with the switch on the power cord after making sure there is no loose plug. Wait for the controller to setup, the small monitor on the controller should display "I1" to "I6" while checking all of the 6 joints of the robot, if the robot is set up properly, the monitor will end up saying "OK". After seeing "OK", wait for a "click sound" from the robot to continue, it might take up to 1-2 mins, please be patient!
