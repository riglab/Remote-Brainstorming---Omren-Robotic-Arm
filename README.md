# Remote Brainstorming - Omron Robotic Arm

Please download the software, [ACE from Omron](https://automation.omron.com/en/us/forms/ace-robot-software-download-request-form), to operate the robot.

There are three wires coming out from the robotic arm:
  - Ethernaet Cable (with USB adapter): Use directly to program and run the robot controller with ACE software.
  - USB Cable (with Matt's name on it): Use to access the interior information from the controller, ex. resetting the timer.
  - USB Serial communication Cable (transparent one): Use to do serial communication with the processor.
