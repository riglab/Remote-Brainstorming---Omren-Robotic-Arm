# Processsing Code

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. You can download it for free from from [Processing website](https://processing.org/download/). Processing use Java for programming, you can easily find [examples](https://processing.org/examples/) or [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2). 

We here use Processing as a medium to transfer the drawing/sketching to positions for the robotic arm. Processing is using serical communication through USB cale to send data to the robotic arm, please make sure you have connect both of the USB cables from the robot to your laptop before starting the program.
